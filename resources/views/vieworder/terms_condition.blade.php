                                        <p>
                                            Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to
                                            collect information on our website. <br>
                                            A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page
                                            server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs <br>
                                            or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
                                            and can only be read by a web server in the domain <br>
                                            that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to
                                            provide a convenience feature to save you time. <br>
                                            The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
                                            a specific page. For example, if you register with us, <br>
                                            a cookie helps MIDAPPAY to recall your specific information on subsequent
                                            visits. <br>
                                            This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
                                            billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. <br>
                                            When you return to the same Bankable Wisdom website, the information you
                                            previously provided can be retrieved, <br>
                                            so you can easily use the features that you customized.<br>
                                            A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web
                                            beacon to monitor <br>
                                            and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based
                                            document or e-mail message, <br>
                                            such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the
                                            computer that the web beacon is sent to <br>
                                            and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and
                                            invisible to the user, but, in general, <br>
                                            any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML
                                            based content, can act as a web beacon. <br>
                                            We may use web beacons to count visitors to the webpages on the website or
                                            to monitor how our users navigate the website, <br>
                                            and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many
                                            messages sent were actually opened, <br>
